## Getting Started

You can try this game here:
[https://game-of-life-next-kappa.vercel.app/](https://game-of-life-next-kappa.vercel.app/)

Important! : now the game works the same in all resolutions, but may be hard to click in small screens...


Made based on this wikipedia article:

Or you can build on your own following these steps after clonning the project:

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
